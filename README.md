# MAPLE: Methylome Association by Predictive Linkage to Expression
An R package for predicting gene activity level for single cell DNA Methylation data

MAPLE is a supervised learning algorithm that is developed to predict the gene activity levels of individual cells from single cell DNA Methylation. It is implemented in R and uses CpG methylation sites in promoter regions to infer the activity levels of the genes. 

Latest version is [MAPLE.1.0](https://github.com/yasin-uzun/MAPLE.1.0)
